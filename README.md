**Problems:**

1: Write a Python program that:

    a) Prompts the user to write a list of words (for example, ['apple', 'mango', 'cashew']). 
    b) Once the list has been entered, the program will ask for a word to search for.
    c) The program will then say the number of times the word was found in the list, or display a message that the word wasn't found. For example: "___ was found 3 times" or "___ wasn't found."

    The code for this program should be placed in the file 1.py

2:  Write another Python program that:

    a) Prompts the user to write a series of numbers, each separated by a space (for example, '3 42 22 108').
    b) Once the user hits enter, the program will ... [I couldn't figure out exactly what you were getting at].
    
    The code for this program should be placed in the file 2.py
