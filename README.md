# Puzzles for Break
Puzzles for Thanksgiving break.

Have fun and give it your best shot!

These puzzles may be hard, and that's okay. Keep on giving it your best work, and you'll get it. Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are your friends.

### Puzzles


###### 1: Write a Python program that:

> a) Prompts the user to write a list of words (for example, ['apple', 'mango', 'cashew']). 
    
> b) Once the list has been entered, the program will ask for a word to search for.
    
> c) The program will then say the number of times the word was found in the list, or display a message that the word wasn't found. For example: "___ was found 3 times" or "___ wasn't found."

The code for this program should be placed in the file list-check.py. You may want to check the hints on this one, because there's some complicated input logic.


###### 2:  Write another Python program that:

> a) Prompts the user to give a number, an INTEGER only.
    
> b) Prints every number up to the given number.
    
> c) Gives the time it took to print every number up to the user's number.
    
The code for this program should be placed in the file number-counter.py



### Conclusion

In these puzzles, you learned basic logic of `if`, `else`, and `while`. You also learned about modules, and more specifically, the `time` module and how to use it, if at least minimally. You learned about `f` strings and you built two programs that created specific functions. After break, we'll do more in Python and work through how to create more complex programs.
